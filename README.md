## Project Details

### Description

    Stock vision is a mobile application that works in iOS and Android. It provides a
real-time stock/ETF simulation using past stock/ETF data and allows users to make
investments using our application’s fake currency and get real-time results/tips about their
investments. At first, the user will sign up, if not signed yet, and then log in to the system.
After logging in, users can see and search real-time stock/ETF values. Stock market graphs of
each cryptocurrency can be seen daily, weekly, monthly, or even yearly. Users can go
through these cryptocurrencies and see the data provided and read the tips given by our AI
algorithms. More importantly, each user will start with a specific amount of fake currency
and be able to use this fake currency to invest in stocks/ETFs. When users make
investments, they can see tips from our AI on how to invest their money, the probability of
values increase/decrease, and receive real-time results when gaining or losing money. With
these tips, users can practice their graph reading abilities and see the results in real time. If
the users run out of the application’s fake currency, they can start over with the initial fake
currency.
    Furthermore, Stock Vision has graph reading algorithms using reliable stock graph
patterns and providing a tipping mechanism for the graphs in real time. Analyzing stock
values will be done with image processing, and a wide range of datasets of stock graph
patterns will be used. Moreover, users' investments will be stored in our database, and the
analysis of the user data will be done. Some tips and results will be provided after these
analyses.
